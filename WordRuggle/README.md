WOrd Ruggle
=============
Makes Word Ruggle easy :P (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ercu.wordfind).
* Wordlist : "all" (sowpods.txt used for testing)
* wordRuggel.cpp : c++ code : runs in 1-2 secs
* wordRuggel.py	 : does not run : unbearably slow 
* wordRuggelnumpy.py : runs in 4-6 secs (dont run with pypy): almost same code as in wordRuggel.py : but used numpy arrays instead of lists :
* wordRuggelnumpypy.py : runs in 2-3 secs (run with pypy) same code as in wordRuggelnumpy.py
